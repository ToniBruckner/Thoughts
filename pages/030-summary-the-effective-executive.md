# Summary: The Effective Executive

## Effectiveness Can Be Learned

### Effectiveness Over Brilliance

There is little correkation between a man's effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination, his knowledge of his business, or his education. 
Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffective.
The fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself achhievment. They have never learned that insight become effecttiveness only through hard systematic work.

Many people rush around in the frenzy and busyness (bright people confuse that often with creativity). The workhorse, on the other hand sets step after step and gets there first, like the tortoise in the fable.

> *The Fable of the Tortoise and the Hare*
> In the fable, the hare(drabbit) is so confident in his speed that he takes a > nap during the race, while the tortoise, though slow, keeps moving forward steadily and ultimately wins. This story illustrates that consistent, focused effort often leads to success more than raw talent or intelligence.

Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources. Nevertheless only effectiveness is the goal to get results out of these resources.
In the end, effectiveness is a habit, a discipline, and a skill. It can be learned.

#### Knowlede Workers doing

One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge workers thinks -- and yet thinking is his specific word; it is his "doing".


### Effectiveness is working on the right things

Working on the right things is what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work.

Education is the one area which when provided can make the knowledge worker productive. And productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to get the right things done. It means effectiveness.

Knowledge work is not defined by its quantity, neither by its costs.
Knowledge work is defined by its results!

### Executive Realities - What is pushing towards ineffectiveness

1. the Eecutive'S time tends to belonge to everybody else
2. Executives are forced to keep on "operating" unless they take positive actions to change the reality in which they live and work
  e.g. people tend to continue to work in the old position (e.g. marketing) although they have been promoted to an executive position and are in charge of e.g. the whole business and should work in this direction.
  If an executive let's the flow of events determine what he does and what he takes seriously, he will waste himself in "operating". He wastes his knowledge and abilites and throws away the little time he needs for effectiveness.
  He needs criteria for him to decide what is really important. That is on contributions and results, even if those criteria is not found in the flow of events.

3. Executives are within an organization (1)
  He is only effective when other people use what he contributes. Organizations are good if the multiply the strength of individuals. Knowledge workers are rarely in phase with each other. So each has to be able to use what others produces.
  Unless the executive can reach these people, can make his contribution effective for them and in their work, he has no effectiveness at all.
4. Executives are within an organization (2)
  The executive sees the outside only through thick and distorting lenses, if at all. What goes on outside is usually not even known firsthand.
  But all thre reuslts are outside, there are no results inside the organization.
  Unless he makes special efforts to gain access to the outside, he will be increasingly inside focused. The higher up in the organization he goes, the more the more he will be drawn to problems and challenges of the inside rather to events on the outside. The thing with relevant outside events is that they are rarely available in quantifiable form until it is much to late to do anything about them.
  **Truly important events on the outside are not the trends.** ***Truly important events are changes in the trends*** e.g. PC → Mobile Phones, Office → remote Work, On-Premise → Cloud
  Such changes, however, have to be perceived. The cannot be counted, defined, of classified. They have to be sensed, felt, and interpreted. Man is not particulary logical is perceptive — and that is his strength. 
  The tremendous amount of computer information may thus shut out access to reality.

### The Promise of Effectiveness

A senior executive should have extraordinary abilities. He should excel as an analyst, decision maker, communicator, leader etc.
What seems to be wanted is **universal genius**, but this is a rare supply. The experience of the human race indicates strongly that the only person in numerous supply is the **universal incompetent**.
Therefore you have to staff your organizations with people who at best perform in one of the abilities with excellence.
So we have to learn to make the best use of people who are good at one area.
if you can't increase the suppy of a resource, you have to increase its yield (Ertrag).
Effectiveness is **the one tool** to make the resources of ability and knowledge yield more and better results.

### But can effectiveness be learned?

If effectiveness can be learned then:
1. What does it consist in?
2. What does one have to learn?
3. Of what kind is that learning?
4. Is it a skill which one learns as an apprentice?
5. Is it a practice which one learns by doing the same things over and over again?

Drucker soon learned through observation that there is no effective personality.
Effective executives differ widely in their temperaments and their abilities, in what they do and how they do it, in their personalities, their knowledge, their interests –– in fact in almost everything that distinguishes one human being from another.

**All they have in common is the ability to get the right things done.**
What all these effective executives have in common is the ***practices*** that make effective whatever they have and whathever they are. And those practices are the same wherever the excecutive operates.
Nevertheless whenever Drucker found a man, no matter how great his intelligence, his imagination, his knowledge,etc., who did not use those practices he lacked in effectiveness.

Effectiveness, in other word is a **habit**, which is a set of **practices**.
And practices always can be learned.<br>Practices are simple, *deceptively(trügerisch) simple*. A seven year old has no problems in understanding them.
But practices are always *exceedingly hard to do well*. The have to be acquired, as well as we all learn the multiplication table, that is repeated ad nauseam until it becomes a unthinking, conditioned reflex, and firmly ingrained habit.<br>
**Practices one learns by practicing and practicing and practicing again.**

If you learn Piano you probably won't be able to play Mozart like Arthur Schnabel did, but there is no reason in the world why you should not be able to play the scales like Schnabel did.
In other words there is no reason why anyone in the world should not be abke to acquire competence in any practice. Mastery might well elude him; for this one might need special talent.<br>
But what is needed in effectiveness is competence, not mastery. What is needed are "the scales"!

There are essentially five practices, five such habits of the mind that have to be aquired to become an effective executive.

1. Effective Executives know where their time goes.<br>
They work systematically at managing the little of their time that can be brought under their control. 
2. Effective Executives focus on outward contribution.<br> They streamline there efforts to results, rather than to work. The start with the question "What results are expected of me?" rather than with the work to be done or the techniques to be applied.
3. Effective Executives build on their strengths.<br> Their own strengths, the strengths of their superiors, colleagues, subordinates, an on the strenght is the situation, that is, on what they can do. They do not build on weaknesses. They don't start out with the things they cannot do.
4. Effective Executives concentrate on a few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results.<br> They force themselves on the few major areals where superior performance will produce outstanding results. The force themselves to set priorities and stay with those priority decisions. They know that they have no choice but to do first things first––and second things not at all. **The alternative is to get nothing done.**
5. Effective Executives make effective decisions.<br> They know that this is, above all, amatter of system––of the right steps in the right sequence. They know that an effective decision is always a judgement based on "dissending opinions" rather than "consensus on the facts". And they know that to make many decisions fast means to make the wrong decisions. What is needed are few, but fundamental, decisions What is needed is the right strategy rather than razzle-dazzle tactics.
