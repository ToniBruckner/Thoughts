# Summary: The Effective Executive

## Effectiveness Can Be Learned

### Effectiveness Over Brilliance

There is little correkation between a man's effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination, his knowledge of his business, or his education. 
Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffective.
The fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself achhievment. They have never learned that insight become effecttiveness only through hard systematic work.

Many people rush around in the frenzy and busyness (bright people confuse that often with creativity). The workhorse, on the other hand sets step after step and gets there first, like the tortoise in the fable.

> *The Fable of the Tortoise and the Hare*
> In the fable, the hare(drabbit) is so confident in his speed that he takes a > nap during the race, while the tortoise, though slow, keeps moving forward steadily and ultimately wins. This story illustrates that consistent, focused effort often leads to success more than raw talent or intelligence.

Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources. Nevertheless only effectiveness is the goal to get results out of these resources.
In the end, effectiveness is a habit, a discipline, and a skill. It can be learned.

#### Knowlede Workers doing

One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge workers thinks -- and yet thinking is his specific word; it is his "doing".


### Effectiveness is working on the right things

Working on the right things is what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work.

Education is the one area which when provided can make the knowledge worker productive. And productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to get the right things done. It means effectiveness.

Knowledge work is not defined by its quantity, neither by its costs.
Knowledge work is defined by its results!
