# Summary: The Effective Executive by Peter F. Drucker

## 1. Effectiveness Can Be Learned

### 1.2 Effectiveness Over Brilliance

There is little correkation between a man's effectiveness and his intelligence, his imagination, his knowledge of his business, or his education. 
Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffective.
The fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself achhievment. They have never learned that insight become effecttiveness only through hard systematic work.

Many people rush around in the frenzy and busyness (bright people confuse that often with creativity). The workhorse, on the other hand sets step after step and gets there first, like the tortoise in the fable.

> *The Fable of the Tortoise and the Hare*
> In the fable, the hare(drabbit) is so confident in his speed that he takes a > nap during the race, while the tortoise, though slow, keeps moving forward steadily and ultimately wins. This story illustrates that consistent, focused effort often leads to success more than raw talent or intelligence.

Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources. Nevertheless only effectiveness is the goal to get results out of these resources.
In the end, effectiveness is a habit, a discipline, and a skill. It can be learned.

#### Knowlede Workers doing

One can indeed never be sure what the knowledge workers thinks -- and yet thinking is his specific word; it is his "doing".


### 1.2 Effectiveness is working on the right things

Working on the right things is what makes knowledge work effective. This is not capable of being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work.

Education is the one area which when provided can make the knowledge worker productive. And productivity for the knowledge worker means the ability to get the right things done. It means effectiveness.

Knowledge work is not defined by its quantity, neither by its costs.
Knowledge work is defined by its results!

### 1.3Executive Realities - What is pushing towards ineffectiveness

1. the Eecutive'S time tends to belonge to everybody else
2. Executives are forced to keep on "operating" unless they take positive actions to change the reality in which they live and work
  e.g. people tend to continue to work in the old position (e.g. marketing) although they have been promoted to an executive position and are in charge of e.g. the whole business and should work in this direction.
  If an executive let's the flow of events determine what he does and what he takes seriously, he will waste himself in "operating". He wastes his knowledge and abilites and throws away the little time he needs for effectiveness.
  He needs criteria for him to decide what is really important. That is on contributions and results, even if those criteria is not found in the flow of events.

3. Executives are within an organization (1)
  He is only effective when other people use what he contributes. Organizations are good if the multiply the strength of individuals. Knowledge workers are rarely in phase with each other. So each has to be able to use what others produces.
  Unless the executive can reach these people, can make his contribution effective for them and in their work, he has no effectiveness at all.
4. Executives are within an organization (2)
  The executive sees the outside only through thick and distorting lenses, if at all. What goes on outside is usually not even known firsthand.
  But all thre reuslts are outside, there are no results inside the organization.
  Unless he makes special efforts to gain access to the outside, he will be increasingly inside focused. The higher up in the organization he goes, the more the more he will be drawn to problems and challenges of the inside rather to events on the outside. The thing with relevant outside events is that they are rarely available in quantifiable form until it is much to late to do anything about them.
  **Truly important events on the outside are not the trends.** ***Truly important events are changes in the trends*** e.g. PC → Mobile Phones, Office → remote Work, On-Premise → Cloud
  Such changes, however, have to be perceived. The cannot be counted, defined, of classified. They have to be sensed, felt, and interpreted. Man is not particulary logical is perceptive — and that is his strength. 
  The tremendous amount of computer information may thus shut out access to reality.

### 1.4 The Promise of Effectiveness

A senior executive should have extraordinary abilities. He should excel as an analyst, decision maker, communicator, leader etc.
What seems to be wanted is **universal genius**, but this is a rare supply. The experience of the human race indicates strongly that the only person in numerous supply is the **universal incompetent**.
Therefore you have to staff your organizations with people who at best perform in one of the abilities with excellence.
So we have to learn to make the best use of people who are good at one area.
if you can't increase the suppy of a resource, you have to increase its yield (Ertrag).
Effectiveness is **the one tool** to make the resources of ability and knowledge yield more and better results.

### 1.5 But can effectiveness be learned?

If effectiveness can be learned then:
1. What does it consist in?
2. What does one have to learn?
3. Of what kind is that learning?
4. Is it a skill which one learns as an apprentice?
5. Is it a practice which one learns by doing the same things over and over again?

Drucker soon learned through observation that there is no effective personality.
Effective executives differ widely in their temperaments and their abilities, in what they do and how they do it, in their personalities, their knowledge, their interests –– in fact in almost everything that distinguishes one human being from another.

**All they have in common is the ability to get the right things done.**
What all these effective executives have in common is the ***practices*** that make effective whatever they have and whathever they are. And those practices are the same wherever the excecutive operates.
Nevertheless whenever Drucker found a man, no matter how great his intelligence, his imagination, his knowledge,etc., who did not use those practices he lacked in effectiveness.

Effectiveness, in other word is a **habit**, which is a set of **practices**.
And practices always can be learned.<br>Practices are simple, *deceptively(trügerisch) simple*. A seven year old has no problems in understanding them.
But practices are always *exceedingly hard to do well*. The have to be acquired, as well as we all learn the multiplication table, that is repeated ad nauseam until it becomes a unthinking, conditioned reflex, and firmly ingrained habit.<br>
**Practices one learns by practicing and practicing and practicing again.**

If you learn Piano you probably won't be able to play Mozart like Arthur Schnabel did, but there is no reason in the world why you should not be able to play the scales like Schnabel did.
In other words there is no reason why anyone in the world should not be abke to acquire competence in any practice. Mastery might well elude him; for this one might need special talent.<br>
But what is needed in effectiveness is competence, not mastery. What is needed are "the scales"!

There are essentially five practices, five such habits of the mind that have to be aquired to become an effective executive.

1. Effective Executives know where their time goes.<br>
They work systematically at managing the little of their time that can be brought under their control. 
2. Effective Executives focus on outward contribution.<br> They streamline there efforts to results, rather than to work. The start with the question "What results are expected of me?" rather than with the work to be done or the techniques to be applied.
3. Effective Executives build on their strengths.<br> Their own strengths, the strengths of their superiors, colleagues, subordinates, an on the strenght is the situation, that is, on what they can do. They do not build on weaknesses. They don't start out with the things they cannot do.
4. Effective Executives concentrate on a few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results.<br> They force themselves on the few major areals where superior performance will produce outstanding results. The force themselves to set priorities and stay with those priority decisions. They know that they have no choice but to do first things first––and second things not at all. **The alternative is to get nothing done.**
5. Effective Executives make effective decisions.<br> They know that this is, above all, amatter of system––of the right steps in the right sequence. They know that an effective decision is always a judgement based on "dissending opinions" rather than "consensus on the facts". And they know that to make many decisions fast means to make the wrong decisions. What is needed are few, but fundamental, decisions What is needed is the right strategy rather than razzle-dazzle tactics.

## 2. Know your Time

Most people think you should plan your work. Unfortunately, the plans always remain on paper, always remain good intentions. The rarely become achievements. This becomes frustrating.

Effective Executive, do not start with their tasks!<br>
**The start with their time.** <br>
And they do not start out with planning.<br>
**They start by finding out where their time actually goes.**<br>
**Then they attempt to manage their time and to cut back unproductive demands on their time.**<br>
**Finally they consolidate their available time into the largest possible continuing chunks.**<br>

So it is a three step process:
1. Record your time
2. Manage your time
3. Consolidate (zusammenlegen) your time
This process is the foundation of effectiveness.

Effective executives know that **time is the limiting factor**.<br>
The output limits of any process are set by the scarcest resource. In knowledge work this is time.<br>
In the process we call "accomplishment," this is time. In other words, **Time is the fundamental resource that makes accomplishment possible.**<br>

**Time is an unique, outstanding resource**<br>
All of the othermajor resources, e.g. money is quite plentyful. We long ago should have learned that it is thedemand for capital, rather than the supply which sets the limit to economic growth.
People––the thrid limiting resource––one can hire, though on can rarely hire enough good people.
→ **But one cannon rent, hire, buy or otherwise obtain more time.**<br>
The supply of time is totally inelastic. No matter how high the demand, the supply will not go up.
Morover, time is perishable (transient, vergänglich) and cannot be stored.<br>
**Yesterday's time is gone forever and will never come back.** Time is therefore always in exeedingly short supply. It is always the scarcest resource.
All works take place in time and uses up time.
Yet most people take for granted this unique, irreplaceable, and necessary resource.
→ *Nothing else*, perhaps, distinguishes the effective executive as much as their tender loving care of time.<br>
***Man is ill-equiped to manage his time.**<br>

![effective-executive-time](./images/effective-executive-time.png)

The effective executive therefore knows that to manage his time, he first has to know where it actually goes.<br>

### Large Chunks of time instead of Time Wasters

in every executive job, a large part of the time must therefore be wasted on things which, though they apparently have to be done, contribute nothing or little.
The higher up in the organization hie is, the more demands on his time will the organization make.<br>

Yet most of the tasks of the executive require, for minimum effectiveness, a fairly large quantum of time. To spend in one stretch less than his minimum is sheer waste.
→ **One accomplishes nothing and has to begin all over again.**<br>

e.g. if you write a report it may require 6 to 8 hours at least to write a first draft. It is pointless to give seven hours to the task by spending fifteen minutes twice a day for three weeks.<br>
All you've got is a blank paper with some doodles on it. But if one can lock the door, disconnect from communication and sits down for let's say 5 to 6 hours without interruption, one has a good chance to write a what Drucker calls a "zero draft". The one before the first draft. From then you can work in fairly small installments, can rewrite, edit and correct section nby section, paragraph by paragraph, sentence by sentence.

So, to be executive you have to be able to dispose of time in fairly big chunks. To have small dribs of time at his disposal will not be sufficient even if the total is an immpressive number of hours.
This is particulary true with respect to time spent working with people, which is course, a central task in the work of the executive. People are time-consumers. And most people are time-wasters.
So, to get anything done with people and would like to have an impact you have to spend a fairly large minimum quantum of time.
One has to sit down with a knowledge worker and think through with him what should be done an why, before one can even know whether he is doing a satisfactory job or not. And this is time consuming.

the knowledge worker must be focused on the results and performance goals of the entire organization to have any results and performance at all. So he has to set aside time to direct his vision from his work to results, and from his speciality **to the outside in which alone performance lies.**

So an superior has to sit down with his knowledge workers on a regular basis and ask:

- What should we at the head of the organization know about your work?
- What do you want to tell me regarding the organization?
- Where do you see opportunities we do not exploit?
- Where do you see dangers to which we are still blind?
- And all togehter, what do you wand to know from me about the organization?

Without it, the knowledge people either loose enthusiasm and become time-servers and get away from opportunities and needs of the organization.
*Note: What came into my mind when reading that was a quote from Saint-Exupery: "If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn (verlange) for the vast and endless sea."*

![yearn for the sea](./images/yearn-for-the-sea.png)

Among the effective executives Drucker observed people who made decisions fast, and people who make them rather slowly.
But without exception **the make presonnel decisions slowly** and they make them several times before they really commit themselves.
e.g. Sloan, former boss of General Motors never mad e a personell decision the first time it cam up and he always picked winners.
Asked about his secret: "No secret–– I have simply accepted that the first name I come up with is likely to be the wrong name––and I therefore retrace the whole process of thought and analysis a few times before i act". Yet Sloan was far away from a patien man.

### Time-Diagnosis

That one must record the time before one can know where it goes, and before one can try to manage it.

The specific method of recording time is not important to us. What matters is that it is done and that the recording takes place in "real-time", i.e. at the moment the event occurs and not later from memory.


Many people keep such a log continuously and review it regularly every month. At a minimum, they keep it for about three to four weeks at a stretch, about twice a year, on a regular schedule.


Time utilization improves with practice. But only **constant** efforts in time management can prevent one from drifting and wasting time on trivialities.

#### Systematic Time Management – Find the Time Thieves - Time Diagnosis

One hasto find the nonproductive, time-wasting activities and get rid of them if one possibly can.

1. Try to identify and eliminate the things that need not be done at all. Those are purely a waste of time without any results.
Look at the time record and ask for every activty: **What would happen if this were not done at all?** If the answer is "Nothing would had happen", then obviously the conclusion is to stop doint it.

2. Delegation: **"Which of the activities on my time log could be done by somebody else just as well, if ot better?"**

There is a lot of work which easily can be done be down by others and therefore should be done by others. 
"Delegation" as the term is customarily used, is a misunderstanding––is indeed misdirection. But getting rid of anything that can be done by somebody else so that one does not have to delegate but can really get to one's own work––that is major improvement in effectivess.

3. The Time of Others he himslef wastes

Ask others, "What do I do that wastes your time without contributing to you effectiveness?"
The manner in which an executive does productive work may still be a major waste of somebody's else' time.

Possiblit of an invitation to a meeting:
"I have asked [Messrs Smith, Jones, and Robinson] to meet with me [Wednesday at 10 A.M.] to discuss [next years capital apropriations budget]. Please come if you think that you need the information or want to take part in the discussion. But you will in any event receive right away a full summary of the discussion and of any decisions reached, together with a request of your comments"
--> where  formerly a dowzen people came and stayed all afternoon, three men and a secretary to take the notes now get the matter over with within an hour or so. A no one feels left out.

#### Cut the Time Wasters

1. The first task is to identify the time wasters which follow from lack of system or foresight.
The symptom to look for is the "recurrent crisis", the crisis which cames back year after year. A crisis that recurs a second time is a crisis that must not occur again.
A recurrent crisis should always have been forseed. It can therefore always be prevented or reduced to a routine which clerks can manage.

A recurrent crisis is simply a symptom of slovenliness (Schlampigkeit) and laziness.
e.g. a well-managed plant, is a quiet place. A "factory" that is "dramatic", a factory in which the "epic of the industy" is unfolded before the visitiors eyes, is poorly managed.
Nothing exciting happens in it because the crises have been anticipated and have been converted into routine.

2. Time-wastes often results from overstaffing

A work force may, indeed, be too small for the task. And the work suffers, if it gets done at all. But this is not the rule. Much more common is the work force that is too big for effectiveness, the work force that spends, therefore, an increasing amount of its time "interacting" rather than working. If an big fraction of time time is used for "problems of human relations", on feuds and frictions, on jurisdictional disputes and questions of cooperation, and so on, then the work force is almost certainly too large. People get into each others ways.

3. Malorganization - Excess of Meetings

It's symptoms is an excess of meetings. There will always be more than enough meetings.
But if a executives spend more than a fairly small part of their time in meetings, it is sure sign of malorganization.
Every meeting generates a hoft of little follow up meetings – some formal, some informal, but both stretching out for hours.
An undirected meeting is not just a nuisance; it is danger.
Meetings have to be the execption rather than the rule (Kontroverse zu Scrum????)
Exceptions are special organs whose purpose is to meet. The board of directors.

4. Malfunction in information

In many organizations, time is not lost because of a lack of work, but because of poor information — it arrives too late, is incomplete, or is presented in the wrong form. Effective communication and proper information structures are therefore essential for efficient work. (e.g. information does not get to the places where it is needed, is not prepared in a way people need it, e.g. averages).

#### Consolidating "Discretionary Time"

The one who records and analyzes his time and then attempts to manage it can determine how much he has for his important tasks.

How much time is there that is "discretionary", that is the time which is available for the big tasks that will really make a **contribution**.

A manager of a big bank always made his meeetings for 1,5h. 
- Asked why, he answered "because i have found out that my attention span is about an hour and a half. If i work on any topic longer that that, i start to repeat myself. At the same time, I have realized that nothing of importnace can really be tackled in much less time. One does not get to the point where one understands what one is talking about.
- And furthermore he said: "My sescretary has strict instructions not to put anyone through except the President of the United states and his wife.
- Later on he has half an hour to return every call and read every message. Anmerkung: Er braucht auch Pausen.

Senior Executives rarely have as much as one quarter of their time truly at their disposal and available for the important matters, they are being paid for.

- You have to consolidate discretionary time.
- You know that you need large chunks of time ant that small driblets are no time at all.
- One quarter, is usally engough to get important things done.
- But even three quarters of the working day are useless if they are only available as fifteen hours here or half an hour there.
--> The final step in time management is therefore to consolidate the time that is available visible through record and analysis and under the executive's control.
