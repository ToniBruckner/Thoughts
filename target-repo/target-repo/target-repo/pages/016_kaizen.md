# Kaizen - Continuous Improvement

tbc

from the book GRIT:
```
Kaizen is Japanese for resisting the plateau of arrested development. Its literal translation is: “continuous improvement.” A while back, the idea got some traction in American business culture when it was touted as the core principle behind Japan’s spectacularly efficient manufacturing economy.

In her interviews with “mega successful” people, journalist Hester
Lacey has noticed that all of them demonstrate a striking desire to excel beyond
their already remarkable level of expertise: “An actor might say, ‘I may never
play a role perfectly, but I want to do it as well as I possibly can. And in every
role, I want to bring something new. I want to develop.’ A writer might say, ‘I
want every book I do to be better than the last.’
“It’s a persistent desire to do better,” Hester explained. “It’s the opposite of
being complacent. But it’s a positive state of mind, not a negative one. It’s not
looking backward with dissatisfaction. It’s looking forward and wanting to
grow.”
