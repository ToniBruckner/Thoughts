# Plan With Your Obstacles

### Danger of Positive Fantasizing

From the book GRIT:

``` 
This is what my good friend and fellow psychologist Gabriele Oettingen calls
“positive fantasizing.” Gabriele’s research suggests that indulging in visions of a
positive future without figuring out how to get there, chiefly by considering
what obstacles stand in the way, has short-term payoffs but long-term costs. In
the short-term, you feel pretty great about your aspiration to be a doctor. In the
long-term, you live with the disappointment of not having achieved your goal.
```

This excerpt explains a psychological concept called **"positive fantasizing,"** as described by Gabriele Oettingen. Here’s a breakdown of what it means:

### **Positive Fantasizing**
- **Definition**: It refers to imagining an idealized, positive future outcome without adequately addressing the steps or challenges required to achieve it.
- **Short-Term Effect**: Positive fantasizing can make you feel good in the moment because envisioning success is naturally uplifting and motivating.
  - Example: Dreaming about becoming a doctor may fill you with pride, excitement, and a sense of purpose.
- **Long-Term Effect**: The lack of realistic planning and failure to consider obstacles can lead to disappointment when you fail to achieve the goal because the fantasies weren’t grounded in actionable steps.
  - Example: If you don’t study enough, prepare for exams, or address the hurdles on the path to becoming a doctor, the goal remains a dream rather than a reality.

### **Key Message**
Oettingen's research suggests that **uncritical daydreaming about success** can have counterproductive effects. While visualizing success might feel good temporarily, it can prevent you from effectively addressing the challenges and making concrete progress. In other words, **positive fantasies without realistic planning or effort set you up for long-term frustration and disappointment.**

### **WOOP Strategy**
Instead of just indulging in positive fantasies, Oettingen advocates for balancing optimism with realism. Her **WOOP strategy** emphasizes:
1. **Wish**: Identify your aspiration or goal.
2. **Outcome**: Visualize the best outcome of achieving your goal.
3. **Obstacle**: Recognize the obstacles in your way.
4. **Plan**: Develop a plan to overcome those obstacles.
