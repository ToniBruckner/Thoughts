# GRIT

The following text is from the book GRIT by Angela Duckworth

```quote
Research shows that people are enormously more satisfied with their
jobs when they do something that fits their personal interests. This is the
conclusion of a meta-analysis that aggregated data from almost a hundred
different studies that collectively included working adults in just about every
conceivable profession. For instance, people who enjoy thinking about abstract
ideas are not happy managing the minutiae of logistically complicated projects;
they’d rather be solving math problems. And people who really enjoy
interacting with people are not happy when their job is to work alone at a
computer all day; they’re much better off in jobs like sales or teaching. What’s
more, people whose jobs match their personal interests are, in general, happier
with their lives as a whole.
Second, people perform better at work when what they do interests them.
This is the conclusion of another meta-analysis of sixty studies conducted over
the past sixty years. Employees whose intrinsic personal interests fit with their
occupations do their jobs better, are more helpful to their coworkers, and stay
at their jobs longer. College students whose personal interests align with their
major earn higher grades and are less likely to drop out.
It’s certainly true that you can’t get a job just doing anything you enjoy. It’s
tough to make a living playing Minecraft, no matter how good you get at it. And
there are a lot of people in the world whose circumstances preclude the luxury
of choosing among a broad array of occupational options. Like it or not, there
are very real constraints in the choices we can make about how we earn a
living.
Nevertheless, as William James foretold a century ago, these new scientific
findings affirm commencement speech wisdom: the “casting vote” for how well
we can expect to do in any endeavor is “desire and passion, the strength of
[our] interest. . . .”

## Formula for GRIT

Here’s the corrected and refined version of your text for clarity and coherence:

You can develop strong **skills** if you possess a certain amount of talent (such as natural aptitude, interest, enjoyment in trying things out, etc.) and focus on it with dedicated effort. When you combine effort with talent, the effect is not simply additive—it’s multiplicative, leading to significantly greater skill development.

`
Talent × Effort = Skill
`


Once you’ve acquired a skill, you can truly **achieve** something by applying that skill and continuing to put in the necessary effort to reach your goals. This consistent application of skill and effort leads to meaningful achievements.

`
**Skill × Effort = Achievement**
`

This is what my good friend and fellow psychologist Gabriele Oettingen calls
“positive fantasizing.” Gabriele’s research suggests that indulging in visions of a
positive future without figuring out how to get there, chiefly by considering
what obstacles stand in the way, has short-term payoffs but long-term costs. In
the short-term, you feel pretty great about your aspiration to be a doctor. In the
long-term, you live with the disappointment of not having achieved your goal.
